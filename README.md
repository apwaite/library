A simple Library app that allows the user to add and view the books they're reading. The user simply clicks the "+ Add New Book" button where they're asked to enter the book title, author, total number of pages and whether they've read the book. From this form menu the user can choose to close the form, clear the form or add the book they've entered; if the user chooses to add the book it's displayed on a card where the user can toggle the read status between "Read" and "Unread" or optionally remove the book altogether. Books that are added to the library are stored using the localStorage feature which ensures books entered by the user persist even after the page has been refreshed or the browser window is closed.
